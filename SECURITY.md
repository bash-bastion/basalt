# Basalt Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

This policy is designed to improve the reporting of vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy applies to all code in this repository

## Rewards

At this time, no "Bug Bounties" are rewarded. But, if you wish, you'll get a mention by me (@hyperupcall) on Twitter!

## Guidelines

Guidelines for finding vulnerabilities are the same as [Gradle's](https://github.com/gradle/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md#guidelines)

## Reporting Security ISsues

**Do not report issues through public GitHub issues**

Rather, send an email to `edwin [at] kofler [dot] dev`. If I don't reply, get my attention on Twitter (@hyperupcall)

Please be as descriptive as reasonably possible.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
