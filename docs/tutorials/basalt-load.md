# basalt-load

The `basalt-load` is available for `Bash` and `Zsh` environments

```sh
basalt-load global 'rupa/z' 'z.sh'
bash: /home/edwin/data/basalt/source/pkg/bin/basalt-load: Permission denied
```

Problem: forgot to `source basalt-load`. If you already do `basalt init <shell>`, this should not happen to you
